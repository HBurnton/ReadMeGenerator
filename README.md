# Read Me Generator

## Description
Creating READMEs can be fun but can also take time away from your project. Why waste any more time messing with formatting, hash signs, or anything else that is not your project? This streamlined CLI allows you to quickly make a README with all of the bells and whistles that you need to make a quick, professional and simple README.md file. In fact, this file was made using this app!
